# my-dev-env

This is just for me to quickly setup some services. For now:

- Postgres
    - Username: admin
    - Password: Beheer_01
- (pgAdmin)[http://localhost:18080]
    - Username: admin@localhost
    - Password: Beheer_01
- (Keycloak)[http://localhost:18081]
    - Username: admin
    - Password: Beheer_01

This is definitely not production ready and secure!
